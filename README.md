# Interactive Named Entity Recognition (NER) Visualizer
![alt text](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

An intuitive and interactive tool to visualize Named Entity Recognition (NER) annotations on your text data. This visualizer helps you explore, analyze, and understand the outputs of your NER models in a user-friendly web interface.

Data exploration is a critical part of developing effective NER systems. This tool makes it easy to identify patterns and potential errors in your model's predictions, allowing for faster iteration and improvement.[1]

## üåü Features
- Interactive Interface: Simply paste your text and see the named entities highlighted instantly.
- Customizable Entity Labels: Filter and display only the entity types you are interested in.[1]
- Model Agnostic: Works with the output of any NER model (spaCy, NLTK, Transformers, etc.) as long as it's provided in a simple JSON format.
- Easy to Deploy: Can be run locally or easily deployed as a web application.
- Customizable Colors: Assign custom colors to different entity types for better visualization.[2]

## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Flask (or another web framework of your choice)
(Add any other specific libraries your project requires)

### Installation

#### Clone the repository:

- git clone https://github.com/your-username/Interactive-Named-Entity-Recognition-Visualizer.git
- cd Interactive-Named-Entity-Recognition-Visualizer

#### Install the required packages:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

- Run the application:

- python app.py

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use
- Input your text: Paste the text you want to analyze into the main text area.
- Provide entity annotations: In the second text area, provide the named entities in a JSON format. The expected format is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents an entity and includes the start character index, end character index, and label.

Example JSON format:

[
  {"start": 22, "end": 36, "label": "PERSON"},
  {"start": 54, "end": 60, "label": "ORG"}
]

- Visualize: Click the "Visualize" button to see the entities highlighted in the text.
- Filter Entities: Use the checkboxes to show or hide specific entity types.

### üõ†Ô∏è Built With
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Flask (Python)
- NER Processing: (Mention any specific libraries you use for NER, e.g., spaCy, NLTK)
- This project is inspired by the visualization capabilities of tools like spaCy's displaCy.[3][4]
